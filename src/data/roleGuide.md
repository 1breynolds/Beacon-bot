# 🎯 Leveling & Rank Roles

Here’s the rundown on how leveling works in the server. You can level up by talking in chat or hanging out in voice, both help you climb the ranks and unlock more perks.

## 🗨️ Text Leveling

- You get XP for sending messages in normal chat.
- **Spam does not count!**.
- Some channels (like `#bot-commands`) won’t give XP.

**Just talk like you usually would and you’ll level naturally.**

## 🎙️ Voice Leveling

- You earn XP by being active in voice chats.
- If someone else is in VC with you, you earn XP faster.
- There’s a daily cap so nobody can AFK farm.

**Hang out, talk to people, level up.**

## ⚖️ How Your Rank Is Calculated

Both your **text level** and **voice level** combine into one **overall level**.

Your rank goes up every time your combined level hits the next bracket.  
The system is automatic, no need to track anything manually.

## 🏅 Why Rank Up?

Ranking up gives you:
- More server access
- Better perks
- More influence in the community

And honestly, it just feels good to see your level climb.

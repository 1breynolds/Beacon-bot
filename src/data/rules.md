**1. Be Respectful**
Treat everyone like a normal human being. No harassment, hate speech, bullying, or discrimination. Just keep things civil.

**2. Respect Staff Decisions**
If something comes up, talk to a mod or admin privately instead of starting drama in chat.

**3. Keep Channels On-Topic**
Use the right channels for the right conversations. Avoid spamming, flooding, or derailing discussions.

**4. No Harmful or Inappropriate Content**
Don’t post anything illegal, explicit, or otherwise unsafe. Keep the space comfortable for everyone.

**5. Keep Your Profile Appropriate**
Usernames and profile pictures should follow the same rules: nothing offensive, impersonating others, or inappropriate.

**6. No Unwanted Advertising**
Don’t drop random links, ads, or self-promo unless you have the go-ahead from an admin.

**7. Have Fun & Contribute**
This is a community space. Join in, be helpful, and make it a good place for everyone.
